# Tutorial for a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, using OpenFOAM and CalculiX.

This tutorial is under construction and improvement.

It works with OpenFOAM 5.0 and CalculiX 2.12.

Please run the script `Download_meshes` first.
Then you may run the `Allrun` for a serial run,
or the `Allrun_parallel` for a parallel run.

You may adjust the end time in the precice-config_*.xml, or interupt the execution earlier if you want.

Based on a case prepared with simscale.com.
